        <main>
            <p>Morgan was born in Los Angeles in early 1984 but 
                moved to the town of Bellingham, WA in 1989 with 
                his parents, grandmother, <em>dog 'Noodles'</em>, and his cat Willy.

            <p>Between the ages of 5 and 18 Morgan attended <strong>9 different schools</strong>, 
                up to 3 in the same year of middle school. Morgan graduated Washington 
                State University with a business degree before taking a teaching
                job in Japan, <u>where he lived for the next 20 months.</u></p>

            <p>After returning to the states he worked a number of odd jobs until 
                taking employment at a Telematics company in the customer service department
                before taking on further positions as a technical trainer, troubleshooter,
                and eventually <mark>software tester</mark> which he then did for the next 6 years while 
                also discovering <q>his love for Dungeons and Dragons</q>.</p>
            <p>Leaving his testing job for a software consultancy position he delved further
                into software development, traveling Australia, and welcoming his first born son
                Mordecai in to the world. As that career became less tenable he chose to leave
                and attend Codefellows full time in hopes of honing his skills as a software
                developer to better provide for his family and spend time with his son, wife, 
                cat, and giant dog.</p>
